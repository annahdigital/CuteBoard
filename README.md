# CuteBoard
## Functionality
It's a simple RSS-reader app that provides the following functions:
+ reading news from the entered rss feed (you can use a magic âˆ€ button to randomly choose one of the links provided by the creator :D );
+ 10 latest news will be cached, so you can read them without internet connection;
